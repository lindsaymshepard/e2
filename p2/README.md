## Game planning

* Player A either makes Rock, Paper or Scissors with their hand
* Player B either makes Rock, Paper or Scissors with their hands
    * Create an array with three values: Rock, Paper, and Scissors
    * Use the rand fucntion to randomly choose a key 0, 1, 2
    * Use that to show which move Player A and Player B makes

* Either there will be a winnner or a tie.
    * Use the conditional statements if, elseif, and else to show which player won that round

## Notes for instructor
 * This was a really fun assignment. It wasn't too difficult, but I feel like it really made me think about the arrays and conditionals and made me realize I knew more than I thought I did. Your videos truly teach a student- and I've taken a lot of courses here at Harvard and not had this kind of instruction for programming or this kind of assignment. Thank you!
