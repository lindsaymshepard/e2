## Game planning

* Player A either makes Rock, Paper or Scissors with their hand
* Player B either makes Rock, Paper or Scissors with their hands
    * Create an array with three values: Rock, Paper, and Scissors
    * Use the rand fucntion to randomly choose a key 0, 1, 2
    * Use that to show which move Player A and Player B makes

* Player A will get to choose and be inputted by an actual player.
* Player B will be played by the computer

* Either there will be a winnner or a tie.
    * Use the conditional statements if, elseif, and else to show which player won that round

* The player will choose- it will route them automaticlaly to the process.php file and then bring them back to the index.php file. There will also be an index-controller.php that will store the session information.
