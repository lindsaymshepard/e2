*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include code snippets in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
* I was not able to detect any errors while playing the game. 

### Referencing the course notes on [Form design flow](https://hesweb.dev/e2/notes#/php/form-flow), describe the form design flow used in this project.
* The design flow used is design A. The process goes from index.php -> index-controller.php -> process.php

### Are there any separation of concern issues (i.e. non-display specific logic in view files, display code in controller files)? 
* There were no major concern issues. The code looks correct and is placed in the correct php files. 

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
* No, the code is very clear in what each line is doing to build the game.  This goes for all three files. even the index.php file containing the HTML is clearly defined. 

### List any/all built-in PHP methods used with a brief summary of what the method does
* The method that I found in the code is the GET method. The GET method is used to request the contents of a URL. 

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
* if ($breed == $player1choice) {
    $winner = true;
} else {
    $winner = false;
} 

This is a basic if/else statement, but I liked how simple it was. Mine got more complicated and I think I might have been able to simplify it more. Good job on keeping it simple and easy to understand! 

### Are there any parts of the code that you don't understand?
* No, the code is very clear and easy to follow! 

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
* No, this code is a great example of keeping it simple. I definitely got mroe caught up in developing my statements and I think that this game is a great example of an easy to follow code. 

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
* No questions! I do have a comment though- this was a really fun idea and different enough from the other suggested games. I really enjoyed the design asepct on the process.php file. Good job, Jane!
