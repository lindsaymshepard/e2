    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p>I currently am taking full time courses at Harvard Extension School in the Master's program for Digital Media Design. This is my last semester and along with the four courses, I am also enrolled in the Capstone Tutorial with anticipation to do the capstone next semester. Before doing this program full time, I was working as a full time freelance digital strategist, mainly helping nonprofits fundraise digitally. After finishing this program, I hope to continue to work in marketing and digitial startegy, but instead work on the product side of marketing within tech.</p>
